In the "Algorithms" folder, we have the algorithm 'Algorithmo_Geoproces_Gerar_CSV.py,' which should be executed within QGIS to process the layers contained in the 'Rua_Tocantins' folder. 
Upon running the algorithm, five files will be generated. These files will then be processed by the Python script 'Algoritmo_Manipula_Arquivos_CSV_P_SWWM.py,' located in the "Algorithms"
folder. In the 'Figures_Article' folder, you can find images depicting the flow map in SWWM.
